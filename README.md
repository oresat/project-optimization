This repo contains files associated with the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Project being conducted by ETM students and graduates. This project is being developed using RMarkdown as per the requirements of the course **ETM 540 Operations Research** during Winter 2021, but the project is still ongoing.

Read the project report to learn the latest status of this project, and feel free to download, use or provide feedback on our Rmarkdown file. We do not yet have a working model but once we do we will focus on writing up a tutorial and and adding functionality as discussed in the *Future Work* section of the attached paper.
